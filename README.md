# Fingerprint Based Attendance

This project implements a fingerprint-based attendance system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an AS608 fingerprint sensor module. The system captures and stores fingerprint data to manage attendance, making it ideal for schools, offices, or any environment requiring secure and efficient attendance tracking. The ESP32 handles communication with the fingerprint sensor and processes the authentication logic, ensuring quick and accurate recognition. This project showcases the integration of biometric security with IoT devices for a reliable attendance solution.

## Getting Started

First, to start the development server

```bash
  npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Second, make sure to upload `fingerPrint-ver3/fingerPrint-ver3.ino` to your microcontroller.

Third, some parts of the code might need to be modified based on the microcontroller you use.
